This notebook is part of a group project for the COdeOp Data Science bootcamp.
Here we acted as a small bookshop that wanted to enter the online market, and we decided to use Amazon books dataset to create Recommender Systems.
We start with topic classification, then the Recommender systems: Popularity-based, Content-based, and Collaborative Filtering.
